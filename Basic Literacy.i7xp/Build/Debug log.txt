    Problem PM_ChalkCheese issued from inform7/Chapter 15/Make Assertions.w, line 1530

      >--> The sentence 'The Poet's Notebook is erasable scenery on the desk' (source
        text, line 9) appears to say two things are the same - I am reading 'Poet's
        Notebook' and 'erasable scenery on the desk' as two different things, and
        therefore it makes no sense to say that one is the other: it would be like
        saying that 'the chalk is the cheese'. It would be all right if the second
        thing were the name of a kind, perhaps with properties: for instance 'Dairy
        Products School is a lighted room' says that something called Dairy
        Products School exists and that it is a 'room', which is a kind I know
        about, combined with a property called 'lighted' which I also know about.

      >--> The sentence 'The pen is a marker on the desk' (source text, line 13)
        appears to say two things are the same - I am reading 'pen' and 'marker on
        the desk' as two different things, and therefore it makes no sense to say
        that one is the other: it would be like saying that 'the chalk is the
        cheese'. It would be all right if the second thing were the name of a kind,
        perhaps with properties: for instance 'Dairy Products School is a lighted
        room' says that something called Dairy Products School exists and that it
        is a 'room', which is a kind I know about, combined with a property called
        'lighted' which I also know about.

PROPER_NOUN_NT'erasing tool' (indefinite)

Problem PM_CalledWithoutKind issued from inform7/Chapter 15/The Creator.w, line 384

  >--> You wrote 'An erasing tool called an eraser is on the desk' (source text, line 15):
    but I can only make 'a something called whatever' when the something is a
    kind I know, possibly qualified with adjectives. For instance, 'an open
    door called the Marble Door' is fine because 'door' is the name of a kind
    and 'open' is an adjective which means something for doors. But 'a grand
    archway called the Great Gates' would not normally mean anything to me,
    because 'archway' is not one of the standard kinds in Inform. (Try
    consulting the Kinds index.)
